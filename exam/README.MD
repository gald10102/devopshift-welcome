The Exam file contains the whole tasks 1-4.

the folder "Task_1" contains the main_t1.tf and the modules for the task.
the folder "Task 2" contains the main_t2.tf and the modules for task 2.
in task 3 we were asked to create modules but i already worked with modules from the begining.
task 4 is in the folder "Exam" which includes the whole exam from task 1 to 4 including the lb.

it is divided that way because i started with the exam folder and then i thought i should seperate it to folders to show how everything works.

i created the following modules:
    ec2 - creating t2.micro ubuntu 22.04 machine
    lb - creating lb and scaling group
    subnet - creating public subnets
    vpc - creating a custom vpc
