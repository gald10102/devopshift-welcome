Task 5 answers:
    The causes for "Invalid provider configuration" can be:
        1. Missing data or incorrect AWS provider - i would fix that by checking the provider information.
        2. Incorrect AWS region for example if you use us-east-1 and the region set to us-west-1 - i would fix that by checking if i use the right region.
        3. Missing authentication for example when a user doent have permission from IAM - i would make sure that i have the right permissions for using the provider.
    Incorrect security group rules:
        1. invalid CIDR blocks for example synax mistake or wrong addresses range (collission) - i would fix that by degining right the addresses spread and make sure the syntax is right.
        2. missing required ports for example ssh or http - i would fix that by ensuring the right ports are open and in the right tab (inbound or outbound).
        3. when one rule allow something and one rule denies it can cause a conflict error - i would fix that by ensuring there are no conflicts when i write the sg settings.
    Missing IAM permissions for Terraform to create resources:
        1. user lacks permissions to create resources 
        2. Missing IAM role for EC2 instances.
    I will fix that by making sure that i have the right permissions for the actions.
